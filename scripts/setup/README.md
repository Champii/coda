Start an OSBoxes Ubuntu 18 VM

Change the setting of the VM to have more than 1 core (or prepare to wait a long time)

Send the setup folder to the guest and run the script:

```
./setup/full_install.sh
```

(Go make some coffee, this is gonna take a while)

The binary will be put in `~/coda/src/_build/default/app/cli/src/coda.exe`
